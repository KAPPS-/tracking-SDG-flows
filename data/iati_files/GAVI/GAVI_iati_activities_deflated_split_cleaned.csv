The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVI’s injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets. GAVI's INS support has improved injection safety practices and almost all recipient countries have found ways to replace and sustain the use of AD syringes and safety boxes.

GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVI’s injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets. GAVI's INS support has improved injection safety practices and almost all recipient countries have found ways to replace and sustain the use of AD syringes and safety boxes.

In line with a 2009 WHO position paper on cervical cancer recommending that routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination be included in national immunisation programmes, GAVI provides support to eligible countries for HPV vaccines that protect against types 16 and 18, responsible for causing about 70% of cervical cancer cases. The form of support provided by GAVI depends on the level of demonstrated ability in a country to deliver vaccines to young adolescent girls. Countries that have demonstrated the ability may apply for GAVI support for nationwide introduction of HPV vaccines.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. GAVI began offering Injection Safety Support (INS) in mid-2001 to countries that wanted to introduce or increase the use of auto-disable (AD) syringes and safety boxes into their national immunisation programmes for vaccines not supported by GAVI. To date, 71 GAVI-eligible countries have received GAVI’s injection safety support (INS), and by the end of 2009 when the INS window closed, 66 countries reported that they were supporting injection safety practices either through donor support or their own health ministry budgets. GAVI's INS support has improved injection safety practices and almost all recipient countries have found ways to replace and sustain the use of AD syringes and safety boxes.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. The objective of GAVI support for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. As such, it is necessary for applications for HSS support by countries to be based on a strong bottleneck and gap analysis, and present a clear results chain demonstrating the link between proposed activities and improved immunisation outcomes. GAVI’s approach intends to deliver and document results. From 2013, the HSS cash-based funding stream replaces the previous support to Immunisation Services Support (ISS), Health Systems Funding Platform (HSFP) and Civil Society funding.

The objective of GAVI support for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. GAVI’s immunisation services support (ISS) is a flexible programme which countries can use to improve their immunisation performance. Countries have complete control over how and when to use their ISS funding on the condition that DTP3 coverage rates continue to rise. One of the first performance-based programmes of its kind, the ISS programme has two main characteristics aimed at supporting countries to increase their immunisation coverage.

In line with a 2009 WHO position paper on cervical cancer recommending that routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination be included in national immunisation programmes, GAVI provides support to eligible countries for HPV vaccines that protect against types 16 and 18, responsible for causing about 70% of cervical cancer cases. The form of support provided by GAVI depends on the level of demonstrated ability in a country to deliver vaccines to young adolescent girls. Countries that have demonstrated the ability may apply for GAVI support for nationwide introduction of HPV vaccines.

Pneumococcal vaccines can protect children from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of severe pneumonia among children living in the developing world, and can also causes meningitis and sepsis. In line with WHO recommendations, GAVI support for pneumococcal vaccines is for routine infant immunisation. Two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are currently available with GAVI support: a 10-valent (PCV10) and a 13-valent (PCV13). When approved to introduce a new vaccine, a country will receive a one-time cash grant to support a share of the additional costs related to the new introduction or delivery of the campaign, with the remainder being funded by the Government.

The pentavalent vaccine, administered in a three-dose schedule, offers protection against five diseases: diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), heptatitis B and Haemophilius influenzae type b. Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014. GAVI support for pentavalent vaccine is in line with WHO recommendations, for routine infant immunisation and primarily targeting children under one year of age. When approved to introduce a new vaccine, a country will receive a one-time cash grant to support a share of the additional costs related to the new introduction or delivery of the campaign, with the remainder being funded by the Government.

Pneumococcal vaccines can protect children from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of severe pneumonia among children living in the developing world, and can also causes meningitis and sepsis. In line with WHO recommendations, GAVI support for pneumococcal vaccines is for routine infant immunisation. Two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are currently available with GAVI support: a 10-valent (PCV10) and a 13-valent (PCV13).
