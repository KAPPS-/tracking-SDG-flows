Until 2013, GAVI has helped to introduce the pentavalent in 70 of the 73 GAVI-eligible countries, with the aim of reaching all 73 by the end of 2014. GAVI support for pentavalent vaccine is in line with WHO recommendations, for routine infant immunisation and primarily targeting children under one year of age.

The objective of GAVI support for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. As such, it is necessary for applications for HSS support by countries to be based on a strong bottleneck and gap analysis, and present a clear results chain demonstrating the link between proposed activities and improved immunisation outcomes. GAVI’s approach intends to deliver and document results. From 2013, the HSS cash-based funding stream replaces the previous support to Immunisation Services Support (ISS), Health Systems Funding Platform (HSFP) and Civil Society funding.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented. GAVI’s immunisation services support (ISS) is a flexible programme which countries can use to improve their immunisation performance. Countries have complete control over how and when to use their ISS funding on the condition that DTP3 coverage rates continue to rise. One of the first performance-based programmes of its kind, the ISS programme has two main characteristics aimed at supporting countries to increase their immunisation coverage.

The objective of GAVI support for Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. As such, it is necessary for applications for HSS support by countries to be based on a strong bottleneck and gap analysis, and present a clear results chain demonstrating the link between proposed activities and improved immunisation outcomes.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented.

The form of support provided by GAVI depends on the level of demonstrated ability in a country to deliver vaccines to young adolescent girls. Countries that have demonstrated the ability may apply for GAVI support for nationwide introduction of HPV vaccines.

The objective of GAVI cash support is to address system bottlenecks to achieve better immunisation outcomes, including coverage and equity. The GAVI approach is results oriented.

In line with a 2009 WHO position paper on cervical cancer recommending that routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination be included in national immunisation programmes, GAVI provides support to eligible countries for HPV vaccines that protect against types 16 and 18, responsible for causing about 70% of cervical cancer cases. The form of support provided by GAVI depends on the level of demonstrated ability in a country to deliver vaccines to young adolescent girls. Countries that have demonstrated the ability may apply for GAVI support for nationwide introduction of HPV vaccines.
