By emphasizing beneficiary involvement, the project will assure that local development decisions reflect the needs and priorities of rural communities. The Government has requested this change to help alleviate the fiscal burden on municipalities.

India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the last decade, but its economy now shows signs of slowing down. Between 2004 and 2011, a period that includes the global financial crisis, India's growth averaged 8.3 percent per year. Expanding social programs lowered the poverty rate by 1.5 percentage points per year during 2004-09, double the rate of the preceding decade. India's growth rate however slipped to a decade low of 5 percent in 2012-13 due to a combination of domestic and external factors, including high inflation, high fiscal deficit and weak external demand for the country's exports. This slowdown carries high social costs for millions of Indians, and threatens the gains made in poverty reduction over the past decade. Under its current 10-year RWSS program, Government of Maharashtra (GoM) seeks to significantly expand the frontiers in the sector with a focus on increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that 100 percent of the rural population has access to safe water and basic sanitation.

The mission also reviewed the PDO level results indicators for their continued relevance and achievability, and proposed to modify two of the outcome indicators. It is envisaged that the proposed restructuring of the DLIs and PDO level results indicators would enable the participating states to meet the PDO in a more meaningful manner within the scheduled project period.

It is the third of a series of three operations of an amount ofUS$70.0 million equivalent. Vietnam has witnessed impressive economic growth and poverty reduction in the past 25 years. Political and economic reforms have transformed Vietnam from one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita income below US$100, to a lower middle-income country within a quarter of a century. In 2012, Vietnam's per capita income was estimated at US$1,755. Using a 'basic needs' poverty line initially agreed in 19982, the poverty headcount fell from 58 percent in the early 1990s, to 14.5 percent by 2008, and is expected to be well under 10 percent by 2014. The country has attained five of its ten original Millennium Development Goal targets and likely to attain two more by 2015.

In mitigation of this risk, the Egyptian Mortgage Refinance Company (EMRC) is moving forward with plans to issue its own bonds. (ii) Inflation: increase in inflation may result in increasing mortgage interest rates across mortgage lenders, thereby affecting the size of loan which beneficiaries will be able to afford. Measures to tackle the affordability problem would include: (a) moving from a buy-down to an upfront subsidy; and (b) reducing cost of construction through improved regulations or change the mix of units between new communities and existing urban areas. (iii) Market risk: inability of a class of households drawn into mortgage obligations, to pay according to amortization schedules drawn up by lenders to expand initial affordability, risking loan default.

The CAT DDO was developed by the Bank to respond to middle income countries' request for loans that better address their immediate funding needs in the aftermath of natural disasters. The overall development objective of the project is to enhance the government's capacity to implement its disaster risk management program for natural disasters. The CAT DDO will provide a source of immediate liquidity in case of a natural disaster. The CAT DDO will complement other instruments in the country and provide a source of bridge financing while other sources are being mobilized following a natural disaster. This operation will support two key policy areas of the Costa Rica Disaster Risk Management Program: (a) strengthening of the institutional and legal framework, and (b) mainstreaming disaster risk in the national development and investment programs. Several risks were identified during project preparation, and those that deserve attention are as follows: (a) Deterioration of Costa Rica's macroeconomic situation due to internal and external factors (rated moderate). Costa Rica currently benefits from a robust macroeconomic framework. (b) Coordination is a systemic risk in any emergency management project (rated low). In Costa Rica, the National Emergency Commission (CNE) has strong capacity for leading an emergency response and institutional efforts. (c) Political risk (rated low). The country is politically stable and has low turnover of senior officials. (d) The procedures implemented prove unable to disburse funds rapidly (rated as low). Given the inherent purpose and structure of the instrument, the Bank team will work closely with the GoCR and relevant Bank departments to ensure prompt disbursement.",2,2008-09-30,2017-10-30,2008-09-16,2017-10-30,,,,,The World Bank,44001,Multilateral,40,International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,44001,Multilateral,40,,,,,CR,Costa Rica,100,,,,74010;WZ;WD;0052,Disaster prevention and preparedness;;;,100;50;50;100,OECD Development Assistance Committee;;;,DAC;WBSector;WBSector;WBTheme,2,,,A02,5,USD,,65000000,33983000,0,0,-2679958,0,0,67859077,2008,4574895.11,1025522.67,10004230.16,,,,,,,,13983377.98,1873970.02,34835439.71,1561641.68,,,

The method of contracting the orientation and employability youth workshops was changed from consultancy services to the use of a standard set of fees, as used by other training courses. The Ministry hired fewer consultants than planned because of a decision to incorporate gradually temporary staff into its formal structure. The Ministry also decided to finance some expenditures envisaged under the project using national resources in order to simplify internal procedures. Moreover, the number of trained workers (financed under the expenditure category of fees) has exceeded the project target.

First, while the additional financing for the project (Ln. 7732-BR) was approved in August 2009, loan effectiveness was delayed by seventeen months (January 24, 2011), due to conditions at the Federal level beyond the control of the State of Bahia. Second, the reduced effective implementation period of 2.5 years has proved to be insufficient to complete the investment cycle for many community subprojects financed under the loan. Third, while the loan is fully disbursed, subproject implementation has lagged, largely due to the protracted Effectiveness delay. The community subproject cycle, from transfer of funds to the community association's account until implementation is complete and the expenditures are verify, is a period of 9-12 months. As all subprojects that are financed with Loan resources are already under implementation, a six-month extension of the closing date will be sufficient to complete both remaining subproject implementation and related expenditure verification.

The grant will help finance the costs associated with responding quickly and effectively to the generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country. At 4.7 percent, Cote d'Ivoire has the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rate in West Africa. In addition, factors associated with a post-conflict environment, such as large population and combatant movements, pervasive sexual violence, and high poverty are generally linked to rapidly increasing HIV prevalence levels. While considerable assistance is already at hand thanks to the generosity of other donors, it is primarily focused on treatment. Available epidemiological data indicates that the use of HIV/AIDS treatment will not be sufficient: a vigorous prevention effort is urgently needed. There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is social mobilization and HIV: prevention services for vulnerable and high risk groups will finance Non government organization (NGO) and private sector-led activities that cover the project target groups, either within the context of the four focus regions or as part of targeted prevention efforts for high-risk groups. The second component of the project is public sector interventions: prevention and care will contribute to the efforts of the ministry of health to provide treatment and prevention services in the four focus regions as well as support the national action plans of three ministries whose mandate covers high risk groups: ministry of education, Ministry of defense (army), and ministry of interior (police).

The project has the following four components. Component 1) The design and implementation of a national information system for social protection will address current limitations of the lack of communication, articulation and dialogue between different systems of information, managed by different agencies. Instead, there will be a holistic design for the gathering, handling, and management of data related to the social and economic characteristics of individuals. In the first phase, the system will cover all families participating in Chile Solidario. Component 2) There are two training sub-components. The first covers training of MIDEPLAN and other government officials, at both the central and local levels. To carry out this activity a unit would be set up within the Department of Social Policy Development within the Social Division of MIDEPLAN. The training supported will include activities to help MIDEPLAN progress in the design of a system of social protection. The second sub-component will strengthen the capacity of the social workers and others who work with the families of Chile Solidario. Training for the social workers is critical given the importance of the interaction between the social worker and the family in the design of Chile Solidario, as well as the complexity of the issues they face. Component 3) The goal of this component is to strengthen capacity within the public sector to measure the impact of Chile Solidario and its associated programs.

Project activities require restructuring for the following reasons: (a) a change in Government policy impacting the major component of the project, (b) the adoption of a new Energy Law in December 2011, and (c) weaknesses in project management and coordination partly due to project complexity. The proposed project restructuring is based on a revised model for rural electrification in line with the new policy (Component 1) with a reduced scope of work limited to grid based extensions, while Components 2 and 3 have been rationalized and streamlined to ensure more efficient focus on critical sector issues with a limited set of new activities in addition to continuation of all signed contracts. The budgets for components 1 (rural electrification) and 2 (capacity building) will therefore be reduced while the budget for component 3 (project preparation and management) will be increased. As a result of the adjustments to the scope of work, the IDA amount is proposed to be reduced from US$ 65 Million to US$ 50 million; US$ 15.0 million will be cancelled and revert to the Republic of Cameroons overall IDA balance to be made available to other purposes.

There has been a fundamental change in Colombia's water policy since the Project was approved. In late 2008, the Ministry of Environment, Housing, and Regional Development (MADVT) issued decree 3200 which provides the regulations for the national program referred to as department water plans. Under the original project design, the municipal governments, through their specialized water operators, were responsible for implementing urban infrastructure investments. In order to align the project with national policy and facilitate implementation, it is proposed to modify organizational arrangements to allow the Department to execute all project components. This is a first-order restructuring as the Project Development Objective (PDO) description has been slightly modified, there are adjusted organizational arrangements, and a new safeguard policy was triggered in 2009. All of the changes have been incorporated into the project operations manual and endorsed by the project Executive committee. The Bank has provided its no-objection to the operational manual, contingent on the execution of the loan amendment.",2,2006-05-26,2015-10-15,2007-03-15,2015-10-15,GOBERNACION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LA GUAJIRA,,,,The World Bank,44001,Multilateral,40,International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,44001,Multilateral,40,GOBERNACION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LA GUAJIRA,,,,CO,Colombia,100,,,,14010;14020;WC;WV;WT;BH;0102;0078;0070;0057;0060,Water resources policy and administrative management;Water supply and sanitation - large systems;;;;;;;;;,8;92;71;11;10;8;33;17;17;17;16,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;;;;;;;;;,DAC;DAC;WBSector;WBSector;WBSector;WBSector;WBTheme;WBTheme;WBTheme;WBTheme;WBTheme,2,,,C01,5,USD,,90000000,37000000,0,0,-1819869,-3892000,0,96042619,2007,,,,,,73952816.91,,,,,,22089802.45,,,,,

Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities.

The restructuring will amend the projects legal documents by: 1) revising the Project Development Objective (PDO); 2) modifying, eliminating originally planned project activities and adding others that are more consistent with the PDO; 3) reallocating funds accordingly across old and new disbursement categories; 4) revising the results framework to be coherent with the restructured components and activities; and 5) extending the closing date by a year from November 30, 2013 to November 30, 2014.

Recent economic reforms in Mauritius have built on a long tradition of economic growth and transformation. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has achieved substantial economic growth of around 5 percent per annum, which has underpinned its economic transition from a predominantly agricultural economy based on sugar production to a diversified economy structured around textile exports and tourism. However, by the mid- 2000s, with the erosion of Mauritius' preferential trade status and rising commodity prices, it was evident that more reforms were needed to further the country's transition from a labor intensive economy to a high-value-added knowledge and services economy. As a result, in 2006 the government implemented a bold reform program structured around four pillars: (i) strengthening fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency; (ii) enhancing trade competitiveness; (iii) improving the investment climate; and (iv)widening opportunities. The reform was broadly successful in restoring competitiveness, achieving economic growth, and creating employment in higher-value-added sectors. Moreover, the reform helped to consolidate government expenditure and reversed the upward trend in public debt. The proposed DPL is being prepared in coordination with the Bank's Private Sector Competitiveness (PSC) DPL. The two DPL series are designed to be mutually reinforcing and to address complementary aspects of the government's reform program while ensuring that the Bank's support remains sufficiently flexible.

Nepal is still emerging from a 10-year armed conflict that ended in 2006 and is currently passing through a momentous and prolonged political transition which is still in a fragile and incomplete state. This transition entails two interrelated processes: promulgation of a new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. The Constitution is expected to lead to a major restructuring of Nepal into a federal state while the completion of the peace process is expected to resolve the integration/rehabilitation of former Maoist combatants. Nepal's peace process is progressing with the closure of Maoist cantonments and political parties attempting to resolve all contentious outstanding constitutional issues. These issues include state restructuring, forms of governance, electoral system, constitutional court, and citizenship questions to be enshrined in the new constitution. Nepal's economic growth has been adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Growth over the past decade has been below potential, relying largely on remittances and tourism. Nonetheless, Nepal has made good progress both in terms of poverty reduction and improvement of social indicators.

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is infrastructure for Marshland, hillside and commodity chain development. The objective of this component will be to expand irrigated area of cultivated marshlands, to increase the use of erosion-controlling and productivity enhancing sustainable land management practices on associated hillsides, and to finance up and downstream economic infrastructure needs articulated by women and men in their communities. The second component of the project is capacity for Marshland, hillside and commodity chain development. This component included strengthening farmer organizations and cooperatives (e.g. good governance and basic operating capacity); extension and training activities to improve production and productivity of farming systems in the marshland and hillsides (e.g. demo plots, soil fertility enhancements, promotion of improved inputs, and IPM); and knowledge generation and dissemination. The third component of the project is project co-ordination and support.
